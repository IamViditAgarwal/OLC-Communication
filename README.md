`The user who is stuck in a location from where they want to be rescued like flood situation, natural calaimity, will interact with the app, will get there location, select the org and send a simple sms to our helpline number. Our system will get the location from sms api and will render the location on the dashboards for the org. They can just live see the person with the complete details `
